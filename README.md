QA Challenge.

this is a Challenge for Acklen Avenue. I decided to use Serenity Framework to Automate the Test cases for the Following Reasons:

- It's Selenium-based Framework
- It's a BDD Framework that use Cucumber to write the functional Test Cases.
- It allows different Desing patterns like Page object or Screenplay.
